    <p id="init">"Why hello there!" You are greeted by a cat. 
        
        <br>It sits on the table. 
        <br>"It's about time you've woken up, i've been waiting all morning for you." 
        <br>The cat is black. 
        <br>He gets off of the table and stands on his hind legs, but that is not the most astonishing thing: he is almost 2 meters tall.
        <br>The cat pours warm rooibos tea into a dainty tea cup, the claw of his pinky pings out appropriately. 

        <br> His yellow eyes are hypnotic. You find yourself no longer caring about his size.


        <br> His grin is devilishly adorable. "Care for a cup?"
