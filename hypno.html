    <h2>"Devil's Bargain" </h2>

    <p id="init">Two hours have passed. 
        <br>You are lying down flat on the floor. 
        <br>You open your eyes in a hazy state and have a look around. 
        <br>The cat is gone. 
        <br>You look down in your lap and notice a small piece of paper, 
        <br>neatly folded with a cute little bow:
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br> "<b>My dear friend. 
            <br>I am sorry to have left in such a hurry, 
            <br>but more urgent matters have taken me away. 
            <br>I know that we will meet again. Thank you for your hospitality.
            <br> To make amends for my commandeering of your pantry
            <br> I have left you the following as a token of my gratitude"</b>
    </p>

    <p id="init">
        <br>You have received: ONE HAND-WRITTEN COUPON FOR A BAVARIAN HEAD MASSAGE FROM Pasha Strelnikov.
        <br>Add this to your inventory. Message your Dungeon Master as to what path you had taken.
